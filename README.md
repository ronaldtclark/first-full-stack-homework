# first-full-stack-homework

** This weekend you are going to create an express app from scratch it doesn't matter what it is ** 

** Read this *entire* page before you start **

1.  The app should have one model with at least two properties
2.  It should have all the crud functionality, (update, delete, get, create)
3.  Should contain All the same RESTFUL routes we have in our fruits app
4.  This App should look very similiar to the fruits app, but its not FRUITS
5.  <b>DO NOT COPY AND PASTE ANY CODE FROM YOUR FRUITS APP</b>, its okay to use it as a reference, but type it out, 
<b>DO NOT COPY AND PASTE it</b>. 

** Hints **
1.  Don't forget to ```npm init``` in order to start your node project
2.  If you get an error message that says module not found, (Did you install the module).
3. READ YOUR ERROR MESSAGES, first try to solve them by going throught the error message, 
then look it up, then compare to code that you know works, like the fruits github repo, then ask a friend.
4.  Set up your db first make sure its connected
5.  Do one route at a time, maybe start with your index route, then move onto creating a route
6. ```console.log``` everything you can think of.
7.  Remember when you are submitting a form you are making a request from the client, and your server
has to respond to that request. 
8. ```res.render``` is for rendering templates (ejs), ```res.send``` is for sending js, remember the res object
is how you 'respond' to the client. 
9.  Use lesson plans from this week, as a guide, only if you are completely lost, but make sure you are giving it 
a true effort and not taking the easy way out.  No Pain No Gain!
